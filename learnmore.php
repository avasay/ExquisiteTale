	        <p class="lead">This is your chance to write creatively! Exquisite Tale is a collaborative creative writing but with a twist. It is based on Exquisite Corpse, a surrealistic style of creating content.  According to Wikipedia, Exquisite Corpse is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule (e.g. "The adjective noun adverb verb the adjective noun," as in “The green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge”) or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed. </p>
